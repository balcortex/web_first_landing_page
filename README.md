## The sketch

First, let's design the skeleton. For this project, I will be using flexbox as the basis.

We need 6 elements in the first flexbox

![The overall sketch](design-process/01-overall.png)

This elements are:
* Nav
* Title
* Info
* Quote
* Sign-up
* Footer

Let's start lying the blocks

## The navigation bar

The navigation bar is composed of two flex containers.

The first container will display the logo only.

The other container will have three items for the links.

## The title section

The title section contains two elements, one for displaying the text, and another for an image.

The second container just contains the element itself.

The first element contains:

* h1 for the title
* p for the text
* a button (sign up)
